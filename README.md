# Legacy Site Endpoints Experiments

This repository holds a first-draft attempt at introducing some endpoints to represent multisite data through the WordPress REST API. It is not maintained; interested parties are encouraged to use [wp-multisite/wp-api-sites-endpoints](https://github.com/wp-multisite/wp-api-sites-endpoints).

For background on this legacy implementation, see the [site options reference spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vI-s8MjbEllCR0_0BmBgaGvKNm1Fa42MCoqaKCwbRyQ/edit?usp=sharing) composed during the Day of REST hack day in 2016.
